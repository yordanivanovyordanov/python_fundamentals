# PRINT PART OF THE ASCII TABLE

# ASCII TABLE - abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding
# standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment,
# and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many
# additional characters.

# Find online more information about ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write
# a program that prints part of the ASCII table of characters on the console.  On the first line of input
# you will receive the char index you should start with and on the second line - the index of the last
# character you should print.

# SOLUTION
# Read the start and the end char index.
# Use a "for" loop to go through all characters within the range.
# Use the "chr()" function to print out the characters corresponding to the numbers in the range.
# Use the parameter 'end=""' to print out the result on the same line.

start_char = int(input())
end_char = int(input())

for chars in range(start_char, end_char + 1):
    print(chr(chars), end=" ")
