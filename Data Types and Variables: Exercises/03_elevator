# ELEVATOR
# Calculate how many courses will be needed to elevate n persons by using an elevator with capacity
# of p persons. The input holds two lines:
# the number of people n and the capacity p of the elevator.

# SOLUTION 1
# Read the number of people and the capacity of the elevator from the console.
# Find the floored quotient of people and capacity "people // capacity"
# Use a conditional to check if the floored quotient of people and capacity is different than 0.
# If it is add 1 to the courses and print out the result.

people = int(input())
capacity = int(input())

courses = people // capacity

if not people % capacity == 0:
    print(courses + 1)
else:
    print(courses)

# SOLUTION 2
# Another approach is to round up people / cpacity to the nearest integer (ceiling),
# e.g. 17/3 = 5.67 ïƒ  rounds up to 6.
# For the round-up calculation you might use math.ceil() function.
# Before you can use it , you need to import math library:

import math

people = int(input())
capacity = int(input())

courses = math.ceil(people/capacity)
print(courses)
