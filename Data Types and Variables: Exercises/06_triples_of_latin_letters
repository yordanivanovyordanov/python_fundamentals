# TRIPLES OF LATIN LETTERS
# Write a program to read an integer n and print all triples of the first n small Latin letters,
# ordered alphabetically:

# SOLUTION
# Read how many triple if small Latin letter we need to print.
# Use nested "for" loops. For each iteration generate new letters.
# Print them out.

n = int(input())

for i in range(0, n):
    for j in range(0, n):
        for k in range(0, n):
            print(f'{chr(97 + i)}{chr(97 + j)}{chr(97 + k)}')
