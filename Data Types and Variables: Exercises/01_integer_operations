num_1 = int(input())
num_2 = int(input())
num_3 = int(input())
num_4 = int(input())

# Declare a variable and use parenthesis to perform the addition before and division
# and the division before the multiplication.
# Use "int" to round the number to the nearest integer after the division.

result = (int((num_1 + num_2) / num_3) * num_4)
