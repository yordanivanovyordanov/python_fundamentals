# WATER OVERFLOW
# You have a water tank with capacity of 255 liters. On the next n lines, you will receive liters of water,
# which you have to pour in your tank. If the capacity is not enough, print "Insufficient capacity!"
# and continue reading the next line. On the last line, print the liters in the tank.
# Input
# The input will be on two lines:
# •	On the first line, you will receive n – the number of lines, which will follow
# •	On the next n lines – you receive quantities of water, which you have to pour in the tank
# Output
# Every time you do not have enough capacity in the tank to pour the given liters, print:
# Insufficient capacity!
# On the last line, print only the liters in the tank.
# Constraints
# •	n will be in the interval [1…20]
# •	liters will be in the interval [1…1000]

# SOLUTION
# Read the input.
# Declare a variable with the tank capacity.
# Declare a variable with the amount of water in the tank.
# Use a "for" loop to go through all the inputs.
# Use a conditional to check if the the amount of water in every input added to the water in the tank
# is less than the capacity of the tank. If it is add it to the total amount of water in the tank.
# If it's not, print out "Insufficient capacity!".
# Out of the loop, print out the amount of water in the tank.
