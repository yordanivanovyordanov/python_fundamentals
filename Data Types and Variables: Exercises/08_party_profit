# PARTY PROFIT
# As a young adventurer, you travel with your party around the world, seeking for gold and glory.
# But you need to split the profit among your companions.
# You will receive a party size. After that you receive the days of the adventure.
# Every day, you are earning 50 coins, but you also spent 2 coins per companion for food.
# Every 3rd (third) day, you have a motivational party, spending 3 coins per companion for drinking water.
# Every 5th (fifth) day you slay a boss monster and you gain 20 coins per companion.
# But if you have a motivational party the same day, you spent additional 2 coins per companion.
# Every 10th (tenth) day at the start of the day, 2 (two) of your companions leave,
# but every 15th (fifteenth) day 5 (five) new companions are joined at the beginning of the day.
# You have to calculate how much coins gets each companion at the end of the adventure.
# Input / Constraints
# The input will consist of exactly 2 lines:
# •	party size – integer in range [1…100]
# •	days – integer in range [1…100]
# Output
# Print the following message: "{companions_count} companions received {coins} coins each."
# You cannot split a coin, so take the integral part (round down the coins to integer number).

# SOLUTION
# Read the number of companions and the number of days from the console.
# Declare a variable for the coin count.

companions = int(input())
days = int(input())

coins_count = 0

# Use a "for" loop to go through all days.
# Use conditionals to check if any of the days meets a certain condition.
# Add or subtract coins and/or companions accordingly.
# Print out the result.

for day in range(1, days + 1):
    if day % 10 == 0:
        companions -= 2
    if day % 15 == 0:
        companions += 5

    coins_count += 50
    coins_count -= 2 * companions

    if day % 3 == 0:
        coins_count -= 3 * companions
    if day % 5 == 0:
        coins_count += 20 * companions
    if day % 15 == 0:
        coins_count -= 2 * companions

print(f"{companions} companions received {coins_count // companions} coins each.")
