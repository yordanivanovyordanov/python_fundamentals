# SUM OF CHARS
# Write a program, which sums the ASCII codes of n characters and prints the sum on the console.
# Input
# •	On the first line, you will receive n – the number of lines, which will follow
# •	On the next n lines – you will receive letters from the Latin alphabet
# Output
# Print the total sum in the following format:
# The sum equals: {total_sum}
# Constraints
# •	n will be in the interval [1…20].
# •	The characters will always be either upper or lower-case letters from the English alphabet
# •	You will always receive one letter per line

# SOLUTION
# Read the number of characters we will receive.
# Declare a variable for the ASCII sum of the of the characters.

# ASCII TABLE - abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding
# standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment,
# and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many
# additional characters.

number_of_chars = int(input())

sum_of_chars = 0

# Use a "for" loop to go through all characters.
# Read all letters from the console.
# Use the "ord()" function to add the digit representation of the character to the sum.
# Print out the result.

for char in range(1, number_of_chars + 1):
    letter = input()
    sum_of_chars += ord(letter)
print(f'The sum equals: {sum_of_chars}')
