# GLADIATOR EXPENSES
# As a gladiator, Peter has to repair his broken equipment when he loses a fight.
# His equipment consists of helmet, sword, shield and armor. You will receive the Peter`s lost fights count.
# Every second lost game, his helmet is broken.
# Every third lost game, his sword is broken.
# When both his sword and helmet are broken in the same lost fight, his shield also brakes.
# Every second time, when his shield brakes, his armor also needs to be repaired.
# You will receive the price of each item in his equipment.
# Calculate his expenses for the year for renewing his equipment.
# Input / Constraints
# The input will consist of 5 lines:
# •	On the first line you will receive the lost fights count – integer in the range [0, 1000].
# •	On the second line you will receive the helmet price - floating point number in range [0, 1000].
# •	On the third line you will receive the sword price - floating point number in range [0, 1000].
# •	On the fourth line you will receive the shield price - floating point number in range [0, 1000].
# •	On the fifth line you will receive the armor price - floating point number in range [0, 1000].
# Output
# •	As output you must print Peter`s total expenses for new equipment:
# "Gladiator expenses: {expenses} aureus"

# SOLUTION
# Read all the inputs from the console.

lost_fights_count = int(input())
helmet_price = float(input())
sword_price = float(input())
shield_price = float(input())
armor_price = float(input())

# Declare a variable for the expenses. Initial value 0.
# Declare a variable which will hold the about of times the shield has been broken.

expenses = 0
shield_breaks = 0

# Use a "for" loop to iterate between all lost fights.
# Use conditionals to check which repairs have taken place.
# Print out the result.
