# PATTERNS

# SOLUTION 1
# First we need to read an integer number from the console by using; "int(input())".

n = int(input())

# Use a "for" loop from 1 to n + 1 (in order to include n) and print "*" multiplied by the rows.
# This will give us all lines of the pattern from the single "*" and adding "*" for every row.

for row in range(1, n + 1):
    print('*' * row)

# Write a second "for" loop starting from 1 to 1 and print "*" - row.

for row in range(1, n):
    print('*' * (n - row))

# SOLUTION 2
# You can use the following syntax;

n = int(input())

for row in range(1, n + 1):
    print('*' * row)

for row in range(n-1, 0, -1):
    print("*" * row)
