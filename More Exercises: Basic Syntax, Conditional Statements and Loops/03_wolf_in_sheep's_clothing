# WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING
# Wolves have been reintroduced to Great Britain. You are a sheep farmer and are now plagued by wolves
# which pretend to be sheep. Fortunately, you are good at spotting them.
# Warn the sheep in front of the wolf that it is about to be eaten. Remember that you are standing at the
# front of the queue which is at the end of the list:
# [sheep, sheep, wolf, sheep, sheep] (YOU ARE HERE AT THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE)
#    4      3            2      1
# If the wolf is the closest animal to you, print "Please go away and stop eating my sheep".
# Otherwise, return "Oi! Sheep number N! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!" where N is the sheep's
# position in the queue.
# Note: there will always be exactly one wolf in the list.
# The input will be a single string containing the animals separated by comma and a single space ", "

# SOLUTION 1
# Declare a variable called array, which will hold a comma separated list.

array = input().split(", ")

# Create a conditional which will check if the last element in the list is a wolf.
# If it is, this means that this is the closest animal to you, so print out;
# "Please go away and stop eating my sheep"

if array[-1] == 'wolf':
    print(f"Please go away and stop eating my sheep")

# Find the index of the wolf in the list.
# Count how many sheep you have.
# Print out the warning to the sheep closest to the wolf.

else:
    wolf_index = array.index("wolf")
    new_array = array[wolf_index:]
    count_sheep = new_array.count("sheep")
    print(f"Oi! Sheep number {count_sheep}! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!")

# SOLUTION 2
# Declare a variable called array, which will hold a comma separated list.

array = input().split(", ")

# Create a conditional which will check if the last element in the list is a wolf using the pop() method.
# If it is, this means that this is the closest animal to you, so print out;
# "Please go away and stop eating my sheep"

if array.pop() == "wolf":
    print("Please go away and stop eating my sheep")
    raise SystemExit

arr_reversed = array[::-1]

for i in range(len(arr_reversed)):
    if arr_reversed[i] != "sheep":
        print(f"Oi! Sheep number {i + 1}! You are about to be eaten by a wolf!")
