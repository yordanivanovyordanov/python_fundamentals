# FIND THE CAPITALS

# SOLUTION
# First we need to read the word from the console by using; "input()".
# Declare a list variable for the results.

word = input()
result = []

# Use a "for" loop to go through each index in the word.
# Create a conditional to check if the character for the current index is upper using the function isupper().
# Append the result list by adding the index of the character to the list if it's upper.
# Print out the result.

for i in range(len(word)):
  if word[i].isupper():
    result.append(i)
print(result)
