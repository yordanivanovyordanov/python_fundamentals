# HOW MUCH COFFEE DO YOU NEED
# Everybody knows that you passed to much time awake during night time...
# Your task is to define how much coffee you need to stay awake after your night. Until you receive
# the command "END", you need to read a single command. According to this command you will print the number
# of coffee you need to stay awake during day time.
# Note: If the count exceeds 5 please return 'You need extra sleep'.
# The list of events can contain the following:
# •	You have homework to do ('coding').
# •	You have a dog or a cat that just decided to wake up too early ('dog' or 'cat').
# •	You just watch a movie ('movie').
# •	Other events can be present and it will be represent by arbitrary string, just ignore this one.
# Each event can be lowercase, or uppercase. If it is lowercase you need 1 coffee by event and if it is
# uppercase you need 2 coffees.

# SOLUTION
# Read the action from the console using the input() function.

action = input()

# Declare a variable which will hold the number of coffees needed.

coffees = 0

# Create lists with the possible commands in lower and upper case.

action_to_lower = ['coding', 'movie', 'dog', 'cat']
action_to_upper = ['CODING', 'MOVIE', 'DOG', 'CAT']

# Since we don't know how many iterations we will have, we need to use "while" loop.
# The while loop will keep asking the user for an input until it receives the command "END".
# The conditionals will check if the action received from the console matches one of the lists.
# If does and it is lowe case it adds a coffee it is upper it adds two coffees.

while not action == 'END':

    if action in action_to_lower:
        coffees += 1
    elif action in action_to_upper:
        coffees += 2

    action = input()

# We need another conditional to check if the coffees are more than 5 and if they are to print
# "You need extra sleep" otherwise to print out the coffee needed.

    if action == 'END':
        if coffees > 5:
            print('You need extra sleep')
        else:
            print(coffees)
