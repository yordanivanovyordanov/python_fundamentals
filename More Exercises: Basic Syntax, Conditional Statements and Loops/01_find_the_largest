# FIND THE LARGEST
# Given a number, print the largest number that can be formed from the digits of the given number.

# SOLUTION 1
# Read the number as a tuple from the console.
# Use the join() method  which takes all items and joins them into one string.
# Use an empty string as a separator.
# Use the sorted() function which returns a sorted list of the specified iterable object.
# Use "reverse=True" to reverse the list.

num = list(input())
print("".join(sorted(num, reverse=True)))

# SOLUTION 2
# Read the number from the console.
# Parse it into a string.
# Define a variable for the list of digits.

num = input()
num = str(num)

arr_digits = []

# Create a function which sorts and reverses the list of digits and joins them together.


def find_max_num(digits):
    digits.sort(reverse=True)
    number = ''.join(digits)

    return number


# Use a "for" loop to go through the list of digits.
# Use the function we have created earlier to sort out the digits and give us the biggest to smallest.

for digit in range(len(num)):
    arr_digits.append(num[digit])

# Print out the result.

print(find_max_num(arr_digits))
