# SUM OF A BEACH
# Beaches are filled with sand, water, fish, and sun. Given a string, calculate how many times the words;
# "Sand", "Water", "Fish", and "Sun" appear (case insensitive).

# SOLUTION
# Read the input from the console and convert it into lower case using the lower() function.

string = input().lower()

# Use the count() method to count the number of times we have "sand", "water", "fish" and "sun" in the list.
# Print out the result.

count = string.count("sand") + string.count("water") + string.count("fish") + string.count("sun")
print(count)
