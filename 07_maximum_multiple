# MAXIMUM MULTIPLE
# Given a Divisor and a Bound, find the largest integer N, such that:
# N is divisible by divisor
# N is less than or equal to bound
# N is greater than 0.
# Notes: The divisor and bound are only positive values. It's guaranteed that a divisor is found

# SOLUTION 1
# Read the divisor and the bound from the console.

divisor = int(input())
bound = int(input())

# Create a variable which will hold the result.

result = 0

# Create a "for" loop, which loops from 1 until bound + 1.
# With a conditional, check which is the biggest number which matches the requirements and store it in result.
# Print out the result.

for num in range(1, bound + 1):
    if num % divisor == 0 and num <= bound:
        result = num
print(result)

# SOLUTION 2
# In this case we could create a "for" loop, which loops from bound until 1, with step -1.
# With a conditional, check which is the biggest number which matches the requirements and print it out.
# Break out from the loop.

divisor = int(input())
bound = int(input())

for num in range(bound, 0, -1):
    if num % divisor == 0:
        print(num)
        break
