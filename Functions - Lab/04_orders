# ORDERS
# Write a function that calculates the total price of an order and prints it on the console.
# The function should receive one of the following products: coffee, coke, water, snacks;
# and a quantity of the product. The prices for a single piece of each product are:
# •	coffee - 1.50
# •	water - 1.00
# •	coke - 1.40
# •	snacks - 2.00
# Print the result formatted to the second decimal place.

# SOLUTION
product = input()
amount = float(input())


def order_total(product_name, number_of_products):
    result = 0
    if product_name == "coffee":
        result = 1.5 * number_of_products
    elif product_name == "water":
        result = 1.00 * number_of_products
    elif product_name == "coke":
        result = 1.40 * number_of_products
    elif product_name == "snacks":
        result = 2.00 * number_of_products
    return result


print(f'{order_total(product, amount):.2f}')
