# SPECIAL NUMBERS
# A number is special when the sum of its digits is 5, 7 or 11.
# Write a program to read an integer n and for all numbers in the range 1â€¦n, print the number and if it is special
# or not (True / False).

# SOLUTION 1

# Read a number from the console.

number = int(input())

# Create a list with the special numbers.

target_sum_num = [5, 7, 11]

# Use a "for" loop, to go through all number is range(1, number + 1)
# Convert the number into a string and use the map() function to calculate the length of each word in the list.
# Sum all the numbers in the iterable.

for n in range(1, number + 1):
    sum_digit = sum(list(map(int, str(n))))

# Use conditional to check if the number is special or not and print out the result.

    if sum_digit in target_sum_num:
        special_num = True
    else:
        special_num = False
    print(f'{n} -> {special_num}')

# SOLUTION 2
# Read a number from the console.

number = int(input())

# Use a "for" loop, to go through all number is range(1, number + 1)
# Declare a variable to hold the value of the sum.
# Declare a variable to hold the string representation of the number. 
# Use a nested "for" loop to go through each character of the string. 
# Add the numbers from the string to the sum of the digits. 
# Use a conditional to check if the condition is True or False. 
# Print out the result. 

for n in range(1, number + 1):
    sum_digit = 0
    number_as_string = str(number)
    for char in number_as_string:
        sum_digit += int(char)
    if sum_digit == 5 or sum_digit == 7 or sum_digit == 11:
        print(f'{n} -> True')
    else:
        print(f'{n} -> False')
