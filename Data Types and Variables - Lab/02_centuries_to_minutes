# CENTURIES TO MINUTES
# Write a program to enter an integer number of centuries and convert it to years, days, hours and minutes.
# Assume that a year has 365.2422 days at average (the Tropical year).

# SOLUTION
# Read the number of centuries from the console.

centuries = int(input())

# Multiply the centuries by 100 to receive the number of years.

years = centuries * 100

# There are 365.2422 days at average (the Tropical year). Use "int()" to convert the floating number
# into an integer.

days = int(years * 365.2422)

# Multiply the number of days by 24 to receive the hours.

hours = days * 24

# Multiply the hours by 60 to receive the minutes.

minutes = hours * 60

# Print out the result using string interpolation.

print(f'{centuries} centuries = {years} years = {days} days = {hours} hours = {minutes} minutes')
