# TRIBONACCI SEQUENCE
# In the "Tribonacci" sequence, every number is formed by the sum of the previous 3.
# You are given a number num. Write a program that prints num numbers from the Tribonacci sequence,
# each on a new line, starting from 1. The input comes as a parameter named num.
# The value num will always be positive integer.

# SOLUTION
number = int(input())


def tribonacci_sequence(num):
    n1 = 0
    n2 = 0
    n3 = 1
    result = [n3]
    for i in range(num - 1):
        n1, n2, n3 = n2, n3, n1+n2+n3
        result.append(n3)
    return result


print(*tribonacci_sequence(number))
