# CENTER POINT
# You are given the coordinates of two points on a Cartesian coordinate system - X1, Y1, X2 and Y2.
# Create a method that prints the point that is closest to the center of the coordinate system (0, 0)
# in the format (X, Y). If the points are on a same distance from the center, print only the first one.
# The resulting coordinates must be formated to the lowest integer

# SOLUTION
