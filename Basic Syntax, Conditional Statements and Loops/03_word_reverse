# WORD REVERSE
# Write a program that receives a single word from the user, reverses it and prints it.

# SOLUTION 1
# First we need to read the word from the console by using; "input()".

word = input()

# Then we need to create a new variable with an empty string for the reversed word.

reversed_word = ''

# Use a reversed "for" loop to add each character to the reversed word.
# Use the build in function "len" to find out how many indices we have in the word.
# We start form the length of the word - 1, because indices start from 0
# To loop until we reach 0, we type as end -1, because the end is not inclusive
# Finally the step is negative, so we type -1

for index in range(len(word)-1, -1, -1):
    reversed_word += word[index]
print(reversed_word)

# SOLUTION 2
# First we need to read the word from the console by using; "input()".

word = input()

# Use a reversed "for" loop to add each character to the reversed word.
# Use the build in function "len" to find out how many indices we have in the word.
# We start form the length of the word - 1, because indices start from 0
# To loop until we reach 0, we type as end -1, because the end is not inclusive
# Finally the step is negative, so we type -1
# In order to print out the result on the same line add "end=''" to the print function.

for index in range(len(word)-1, -1, -1):
    print(word[index], end='')

# SOLUTION 3
# Much simpler and more elegant solution to the same problem is the use of "slicing" which is a
# flexible tool to build new lists out of an existing list.

# First we need to read the word from the console by using; "input()".

word = input()

print(word[::-1])

# Which means print the word[starting from the end: until the beginning: with step -1]

# SOLUTION 4
# Another simple and elegant solution using list is;

word = input()

for i in list(reversed(word)):
    print(i, end='')
