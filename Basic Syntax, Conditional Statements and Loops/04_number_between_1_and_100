#  NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100
# Write a program which reads numbers from the console until it receives a number between 1 and 100 inclusive.
# When the correct number is received, stop reading and print "The number {number} is between 1 and 100"

# SOLUTION
# First we need to read a floating point number from the console by using; "float(input())".

number = float(input())

# Use a "while" loop which checks if the number is < 1 and > 100.
# The while loop will keep asking for a number until the number is within the range.
# If the number is within the range of the while loop it will break out of the loop and print;
# "The number {number} is between 1 and 100"
# Use "f" to format the string and {variable} in this case {number}.

while number < 1 or number > 100:
    number = float(input())
print(f'The number {number} is between 1 and 100')
