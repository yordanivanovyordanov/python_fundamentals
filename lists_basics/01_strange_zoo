# STRANGE ZOO
# You are at the zoo and the meerkats look strange. You will receive 3 strings: (tail, body, head).
# You have to re-arrange the elements in a list, so that the animal looks normal again:
# (head, body, tail)

# SOLUTION 1
# Read the inputs from the console.
# Define a variable which will hold a list with the right sequence of body parts.
# Print out the list.

tail = input()
body = input()
head = input()

meerkat = [head, body, tail]
print(meerkat)

# SOLUTION 2
# Read the inputs from the console.
# Define a variable which will hold a list of the body parts.
# Swap the elements and print the list.

tail = input()
body = input()
head = input()

meerkat = [tail, body, head]
meerkat[0], meerkat[2] = meerkat[2], meerkat[0]
print(meerkat)
