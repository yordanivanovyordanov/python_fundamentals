# COURSES
# You will receive a single number n. On the next n lines you will receive names of courses.
# You have to create a list of them and print it.

# SOLUTION
# Read the number of lines from the console.
# Create an empty list.
# Loop through n-number of times and use a variable to read the current course from the console.
# Add the current course to the list, and print it.

n = int(input())
list_of_courses = []

for line in range(n):
    current_course = input()
    list_of_courses.append(current_course)

print(list_of_courses)
