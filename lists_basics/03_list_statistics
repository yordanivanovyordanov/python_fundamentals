# LIST STATISTICS
# You will be given a number n. On the next n lines you will receive integers.
# You have to create and print two lists:
# •	One with all the positives (including 0) numbers
# •	One with all the negatives numbers
# Finally print the following message: "Count of positives: {count_positives}.
# Sum of negatives: {sum_of_negatives}"

# SOLUTION
# Read n from the console.
# Create a list for the positive and a list for the negative numbers.
# Loop through the numbers in range n.
# Use a conditional to check if the number is positive or negative.
# Print out the positive and negative lists, the number of positive values and the sum of negative values.

n = int(input())
positive_list = []
negative_list = []

for number in range(n):
    current_number = int(input())

    if current_number >= 0:
        positive_list.append(current_number)
    else:
        negative_list.append(current_number)

print(positive_list)
print(negative_list)
print(f"Count of positives: {len(positive_list)}. Sum of negatives: {sum(negative_list)}")
