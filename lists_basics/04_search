# SEARCH
# You will receive a number n and a word. On the next n lines you will be given some strings.
# You have to add them in a list and print them. After that you have to filter out only the strings
# that include the given word and print that list too.

# SOLUTION
# Read n and word from the console.
# Create an empty string, which will hold the values of the current string.
# Loop through the strings and add the new strings to the list.
# Print out the strings.

n = int(input())
word = input()
strings = []

for string in range(n):
    current_string = input()
    strings.append(current_string)

print(strings)

# Loop though the strings.
# Check if the string contains the word.
# If the word is not present in the string, remove the string from the list.
# Print out the result.

for string in range(len(strings) -1, -1, -1):
    if word not in strings[string]:
        strings.remove(strings[string])

print(strings)
