# NUMBERS FILTER
# You will receive a single number n. On the next n lines you will receive integers.
# After that you will be given one of the following commands:
# •	even
# •	odd
# •	negative
# •	positive
# Filter all the numbers that fit in the category (0 counts as a positive and even).
# Finally, print the result.

# SOLUTION
# Read n from the console.
# Create numbers list and filtered lists.

n = int(input())
numbers = []
filtered = []

# Loop through the numbers, and add them to the list.

for number in range(n):
    current_number = int(input())
    numbers.append(current_number)

# We read the command and check all the cases.

command = input()
if command == 'even':
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            filtered.append(number)

elif command == 'odd':
    for number in numbers:
        if not number % 2 == 0:
            filtered.append(number)

elif command == 'positive':
    for number in numbers:
        if number >= 0:
            filtered.append(number)

elif command == 'negative':
    for number in numbers:
        if number < 0:
            filtered.append(number)

# Print out the filtered numbers.

print(filtered)
