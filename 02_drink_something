# DRINK SOMETHING
# Kids drink toddy, Teens drink coke, Young adults drink beer, Adults drink whisky.
# Make a program that receives an age, and returns what they drink.
# Rules:
# Kids under 14 years old.
# Teens under 18 years old.
# Young adults under 21 years old.
# Adults above 21.
# Note: All the values except the last one are inclusive!

# SOLUTION
# First we need to read the age of the person as an integer number from the console by using; "int(input())".

age = int(input())

# Use conditional statement to check if the person is less than or equal to 14 years of age and print "drink toddy".
# If not check if the person is over 14 and less or equal to 18 years of age and print "drink coke".
# If not check if the person is over 18 and less or equal to 21 years of age and print "drink beer".
# If not check if the person is over 21 years of age and print "drink whisky".

if age <= 14:
    print('drink toddy')
elif 14 < age <= 18:
    print('drink coke')
elif 18 < age <= 21:
    print('drink beer')
else:
    print('drink whisky')
