# JENNY'S SECRET MESSAGE
# Jenny studies programming with Python and wants to create a program that greets a user when he/she gives his/her
# name. Jenny however is in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him differently. Can you help her?

# SOLUTION
# The first thing we need to do is get the name of the person she need to greet.

name = input()

# Use a conditional to check if the name is "Johnny".
# If it is, the greeting is "Hello, my love!"
# If it is not, the greeting is "Hello, {name}!" - the name we have received from the console.

if name == 'Johnny':
    print('Hello, my love!')
else:
    print(f'Hello, {name}!')
