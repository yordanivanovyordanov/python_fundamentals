# MUTATE STRINGS
# You will be given two strings. Transform the first string into the second one, one letter at a time and
# print it. Print only the unique strings
# Note: the strings will have the same lengths

# SOLUTION 1
# The first think we need to do is read the two texts from the console.

string_1 = input()
string_2 = input()

# Create an empty strings variable which will hold the value of the current string.
# Create a string which will hold the value of the previous string, by default in the beginning this will be string_1.

current_string = ""
previous_string = string_1

# Use a "for" loop to go through all the indices in the string.
# Since we are using the indices the range will be "string_1".
# With every iteration of the for loop, we will replace a character from string_1 with a character from string_2.
# With the first nested for loop we will add an index with every iteration of the loop.
# The second nested loop we will start from the iteration + 1 until the end of the string.

for iteration in range(len(str(string_1))):
    for index_str_2 in range(0, iteration + 1):
        current_string += string_2[index_str_2]
    for index_str_1 in range(iteration + 1, len(string_1)):
        current_string += string_1[index_str_1]

# Check if the previous string is equal to the current string, if it's not print out the new string.

    if not previous_string == current_string:
        print(current_string)

# For the next iteration of the loop, the previous string assumes the value of the current string.
# In order to avoid concatenation of the strings, we need to restart the current string by emptying it.
    previous_string = current_string
    current_string = ""

# SOLUTION 2
# A shorter and more elegant solution to this problem will be the use of list slicing.

string_1 = input()
string_2 = input()

# The new string is equal to the list of string 1.
new_string = list(string_1)

# Use a for loop to go through each character of the string.
# If the character from string 1 is different from the character of string 2, replace the character in the new string.
# Print the result out.

for char in range(len(string_1)):
    if string_1[char] != string_2[char]:
        new_string[char] = string_2[char]
        print(''.join(new_string))
