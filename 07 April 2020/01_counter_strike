# COUNTER STRIKE
# Write a program that keeps track of every won battle against an enemy. You will receive initial energy.
# Afterwards you will start receiving the distance you need to go to reach an enemy until the "End of battle"
# command is given, or until you run out of energy.
# The energy you need for reaching an enemy is equal to the distance you receive.
# Each time you reach an enemy, your energy is reduced. This is considered a successful battle (win).
# If you don't have enough energy to reach an the enemy, print:
# "Not enough energy! Game ends with {count} won battles and {energy} energy"
# and end the program.
# Every third won battle increases your energy with the value of your current count of won battles.
# Upon receiving the "End of battle" command, print the count of won battles in the following format:
# "Won battles: {count}. Energy left: {energy}"
# Input / Constraints
# •	On the first line you will receive initial energy – an integer [1-10000].
# •	On the next lines, you will be receiving distance of the enemy – an integer [1-10000]
# Output
# •	The description contains the proper output messages for each case and the format in which they
# should be print.

# SOLUTION
# Read the energy from the console.
# Declare a line variable with initial value an empty string.
# Declare a variable for the number of wins.

energy = int(input())
line = ''
wins = 0

# Loop through the numbers until you meed one of the conditions.

while not line == "End of battle":
    line = input()

    if line == "End of battle":
        print(f"Won battles: {wins}. Energy left: {energy}")
        break

    distance = int(line)

    if energy < distance:
        print(f"Not enough energy! Game ends with {wins} won battles and {energy} energy")
        break

    energy -= distance
    wins += 1

    if wins % 3 == 0:
        energy += wins
