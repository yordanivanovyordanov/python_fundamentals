# NUMBER DEFINER
# Write a program that reads a floating-point number and prints "zero" if the number is zero.
# Otherwise, print "positive" or "negative". Add "small" if the absolute value of the number is
# less than 1, or "large" if it exceeds 1 000 000.

# SOLUTION 1
# First we need to read a floating point number from the console by using; "float(input())".

num = float(input())

# Use the condition "if" to check if the number is equal to zero and if it is print "zero".

if num == 0:
    print('zero')

# Use the condition "elif" to check if the number is between 0 and 1 ("small positive").

elif num > 0 and num < 1:  # or use simplified syntax; elif 0 < num < 1:
    print('small positive')

# Use the condition "elif" to check if the number is bigger or equal to 1 and smaller ot equal to 1 000 000
# and print "positive".

elif num >= 1 and num <= 1000000:  # or use simplified syntax; elif 1 <= num <= 1000000:
    print('positive')

# Use the condition "elif" to check if the number is bigger than 1 000 000 and print "large positive".
elif num > 1000000:
    print('large positive')

# Use the same logic for the negative numbers.

elif num < 0 and num > -1:  # or use simplified syntax; elif 0 > num > -1:
        print('small negative')
elif num <= -1 and num >= -1000000:  # or use simplified syntax; elif -1 >= num >= -1000000:
    print('negative')
elif num < -1000000:
    print('large negative')

# SOLUTION 2
# You could use nested conditions here to solve this problem.
# First we need to read a floating point number from the console by using; "float(input())".

num = float(input())

# Use the condition "if" to check if the number is equal to zero and if it is print "zero".

if num == 0:
    print('zero')

# Use the condition "elif" to check if the number is bigger than 0 and nestled if-statements to check if the number
# is; between 0 and 1 ("small positive"), larger than 1 000 000 ("large positive") or else ("positive") number.

elif num > 0:
    if num < 1:
        print('small positive')
    elif num > 1000000:
        print('large positive')
    else:
        print('positive')

# Use the same logic for the negative numbers and as demonstrated bellow you can use the build in "abs"function
# which gives you the absolute value of a number.

else:
    if abs(num) < 1:
        print('small negative')
    elif abs(num) > 1000000:
        print('large negative')
    else:
        print('negative')
