# ZEROS TO BACK
# Write a program that receives a single string (integers separated by a comma and space ", "),
# finds all the zeros and moves them to the back without messing up the other elements.
# Print the resulting integer list.

# SOLUTION
num_list = input().split(", ")
nums = []
zeros = []

for num in num_list:
    if not num == "0":
        nums.append(int(num))
    else:
        zeros.append(int(num))

new_list = nums + zeros
print(new_list)
