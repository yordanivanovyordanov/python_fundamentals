# NEXT HAPPY YEAR
# You're saying good-bye your best friend, "See you next happy year". Happy Year is the year with only distinct
# digits, (e.g) 2018. Write a program that receives an integer number and finds the next happy year.

# SOLUTION 1
# First we need to read the year as an integer number from the console by using; "int(input())"
# Add 1 so we can find out which is the next happy year.

year = int(input()) + 1

# Since we don't have upper range for the year, we have to use a "while" loop.
# In the while loop use the functions "len" which gives you the length of the string and
# the function "set" which will give you all the unique characters in a string.
# In order to use the set function we need to parse the year into a string "(str(year))"
# "len(set(str(year)))" will give you the number of the UNIQUE characters in the year.
# "len(str(year))" will give you the number of the characters in the year.
# Use "year += 1" and the while loop will add an year until the condition is met and print it out.

while len(set(str(year))) != len(str(year)):
    year += 1

print(year)

# SOLUTION 2
# First we need to read the year as an integer number from the console by using; "int(input())".

year = int(input())

# Since we don't have upper range for the year, we have to use a "while" loop.
# We could also use a "while True:" with a conditional "if" to check if the condition is met.
# In this case we can ask id the length of the string of this year is the same as the length of --->
# ---> the string with unique characters, print and break out of the loop.
# NB! Make sure to add 1 year for every iteration of the while loop and --->
# ---> use "break" to break the loop when the condition is met in order to avoid an infinite loop!

while True:
    if len(str(year)) == len(set(str(year))):
        print(year)
        break
    year += 1
