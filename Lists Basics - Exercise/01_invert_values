#  INVERT VALUES
# Write a program that receives a single string containing numbers separated by a single space.
# Print a list containing the opposite of each number.

# SOLUTION
# Read the string from the console.
# Use the split method "split()" to convert the string into other data types like lists by breaking
# by into pieces. Python provides us with two methods: .split() and .rsplit().
# Create a list to hold the opposite numbers.
# Loop through the numbers in the string.
# Use the "append(-int(num))" to convert the value of the numbers in the string.

num_string = input().split(" ")
nums = []

for num in num_string:
    nums.append(-int(num))

print(nums)
