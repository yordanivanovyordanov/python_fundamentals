# SURVIVAL OF THE BIGGEST
# Write a program that receives a list of integer numbers and a number n. The number n represents the amount
# of numbers to remove from the list. You should remove the smallest ones.
# Input
# On the first line you will receive a string (numbers separated by a space), on the second line you will
# receive a number n (count of numbers to remove).
# Output
# Print all the numbers that are left in the list.

# SOLUTION
# Read the numbers from the list.
# Read the numbers which have to be removed.
# Create a list for the numbers.

num_list = input().split(" ")
n = int(input())
nums = []

# Loop through the numbers and append hte list.

for number in num_list:
    nums.append(int(number))

# Remove the smallest n numbers from the list, and print out the result.

for min_number in range(1, n + 1):
    nums.remove(min(nums))

print(nums)
