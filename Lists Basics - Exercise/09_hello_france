# HELLO FRANCE
# The budget was enough to get Ali and her friends to Frankfurt and they have some money left,
# but their final aim is to go to France, which means that they will need more finances.
# They’ve decided to make profit by buying items on discount from the Thrift Shop and selling them for a
# higher price. You must help them.
# Create a program that calculates the profit after buying some items and selling them on a higher price.
# In order to fulfil that, you are going to need certain data - you will receive a collection of items and a
# budget in the following format:
# {type->price|type->price|type->price……|type->price}
# {budget}
# The prices for each of the types cannot exceed a certain price, which is given bellow:
# Type	Maximum Price
# Clothes	50.00
# Shoes	35.00
# Accessories	20.50
# If a price for a certain item is higher than the maximum price, don’t buy it. Every time you buy an item,
# you have to reduce the budget with the value of its price. If you don’t have enough money for it,
# you can’t buy it. Buy as much items as you can.
# You have to increase the price of each of the items you have successfully bought with 40%.
# Print the list with the new prices and the profit you will gain from selling the items.
# They need exactly 150$ for tickets for the train, so if their budget after selling the products is enough –
# print – "Hello, France!" and if not – "Time to go."
# Input / Constraints
# •	On the 1st line you are going to receive the items with their prices in the format described above –
# real numbers in the range [0.00……1000.00]
# •	On the 2nd line, you are going to be given the budget – a real number in the range [0.0….1000.0]
# Output
# •	Print the list with the bought item’s new prices, rounded 2 digits after the decimal separator in the
# following format:
# "{price1} {price2} {price3} {price5}………{priceN}"
# •	Print the profit, rounded 2 digits after the decimal separator in the following format:
# "Profit: {profit}"
# •	If the money for tickets are enough, print: "Hello, France!" and if not – "Time to go."
