#  MULTIPLE LISTS
# Write a program that receives two numbers (factor and count) and creates a list with length of the
# given count and contains only elements that are multiples of the given factor.

# SOLUTION
# Read the factor and the count numbers from the console.
# Create a list for the results.
# Loop through the numbers and check which numbers are matching the condition.
# Append the lists and print out the result.

factor = int(input())
count = int(input())

result = []

for number in range(1, factor * count + 1):
    if number % factor == 0:
        result.append(number)

print(result)
