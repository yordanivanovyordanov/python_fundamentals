# FOOTBALL CARDS
# Most football fans love it for the goals and excitement. Well, this problem doesn't.
# You are to handle the referee's little notebook and count the players who were sent off for fouls
# and misbehavior.
# The rules: Two teams, named "A" and "B" have 11 players each. The players on each team are numbered
# from 1 to 11. Any player may be sent off the field by being given a red card. If one of the
# teams has less than 7 players remaining, the game is stopped immediately by the referee,
# and the team with less than 7 players loses.
# A card is a string with the team's letter ('A' or 'B') followed by a single dash and player's number.
# e.g. the card 'B-7' means player #7 from team B received a card.
# The task: Given a list of cards (could be empty), return the number of remaining players on each
# team at the end of the game in the format: "Team A - {players_count}; Team B - {players_count}".
# If the game was terminated print an additional line: "Game was terminated"
# Note for the random tests: If a player that has already been sent off receives another card -
# ignore it.
# Input
# The input (the cards) will come on a single line separated by a single space.
# Output
# Print the remaining players as described above and add another line (as shown above)
# if the game was terminated.

# SOLUTION
# Read the cards string from the console.
# Use sets to record all the distinct banned players from each team.
# Loop through the cards and check which players from both teams have been banned.
# Use a conditional to check if any of the teams has been left with less than 7 players,
# and if the game has been terminated.
# Print out the result.

cards = input().split(" ")
banned_players_team_a = set()
banned_players_team_b = set()

for card in cards:
    tokens = card.split("-")
    team = tokens[0]
    player = int(tokens[1])

    if team == 'A':
        banned_players_team_a.add(player)
    else:
        banned_players_team_b.add(player)

remaining_team_a = 11 - len(banned_players_team_a)
remaining_team_b = 11 - len(banned_players_team_b)

print(f'Team A - {remaining_team_a}; Team B - {remaining_team_b}')

if remaining_team_b < 7 or remaining_team_a < 7:
    print("Game was terminated")
