# EASTER GIFTS
# As a good friend, you decide to buy presents for your friends.
# Create a program that helps you plan the gifts for your friends and family. First,
# you are going to receive the gifts you plan on buying on a single line, separated by space,
# in the following format:
# "{gift1} {gift2} {gift3}… {giftn}"
# Then you will start receiving commands until you read the "No Money" message. There are three possible commands:
# •	"OutOfStock {gift}"
# o	Find the gifts with this name in your collection, if there are any, and change their values to "None".
# •	"Required {gift} {index}"
# o	Replace the value of the current gift on the given index with this gift, if the index is valid.
# •	"JustInCase {gift}"
# o	Replace the value of your last gift with this one.
# In the end, print the gifts on a single line, except the ones with value "None",
# separated by a single space in the following format:
# "{gift1} {gift2} {gift3}… {giftn}"
# Input / Constraints
# •	On the 1st line you are going to receive the names of the gifts, separated by a single space.
# •	On the next lines, until the "No Money" command is received, you will be receiving commands.
# •	The input will always be valid.
# Output
# •	Print the gifts in the format described above.

    elif args[0] == "Required":
        index = int(args[2])
