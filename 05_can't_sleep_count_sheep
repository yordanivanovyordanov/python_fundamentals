# CAN'T SLEEP? COUNT SHEEP
# If you can't sleep, just count sheep! Given a non-negative integer, 3 for example, return a string with a murmur:
# "1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep..." Input will always be valid, i.e. no negative integers.

# SOLUTION
# First we need to read the integer number from the console by using; "int(input())".

sheep = int(input())

# Use a "for" loop starting from 1 until the number of sheep + 1.
# Use "f" to print the number of "{sheep} sheep...".
# In order to print out the result on the same line add "end=''" to the print function.

for sheep in range(1, sheep + 1):
    print(f'{sheep} sheep...', end='')
