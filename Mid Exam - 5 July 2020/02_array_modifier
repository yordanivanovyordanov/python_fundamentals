# ARRAY MODIFIER
# You are given an array with integers. Write a program to modify the elements after receive the
# commands “swap”, “multiply” or “decrease”.
# •	“swap {index1} {index2}” take two elements and swap their places.
# •	“multiply {index1} {index2}” take element at the 1st index and multiply it with element at 2nd index.
# Save the product at the 1st index.
# •	“decrease” decreases all elements in the array with 1.
# Input
# On the first input line you will be given the initial array values separated by a single space.
# On the next lines you will receive commands until you receive the command “end”.
# The commands are as follow:
# •	“swap {index1} {index2}”
# •	“multiply {index1} {index2}”
# •	“decrease”
# Output
# The output should be printed on the console and consist element of the modified array –
# separated by “, “(comma and single space).
# Constraints
# •	Commands will be: “swap”, “multiply”, “decrease” and “end”
# •	Elements of the array will be integer numbers in the range [-231...231]
# •	Count of the array elements will be in the range [2...100]
# •	Indexes will be always in the range of the array

# SOLUTION
# Read the list of numbers from the console and split it.

numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Loop through the list while you receive the command "end".
# Use conditional to check each command and execute it.

while True:
    command = input().split()
    if command[0] == 'end':
        print(', '.join(map(str, numbers)))
        break
    elif command[0] == 'decrease':
        numbers = [x - 1 for x in numbers]
    elif command[0] == 'swap':
        numbers[int(command[1])], numbers[int(command[2])] = numbers[int(command[2])], numbers[int(command[1])]
    elif command[0] == 'multiply':
        numbers[int(command[1])] *= numbers[int(command[2])]
