# NUMBERS
# Write a program to read a sequence of integers and find and print the top 5 numbers that are greater than
# the average value in the sequence, sorted in descending order.
# Input
# Read from the console a single line holding space separated number.
# Output
# Print the above described numbers on a single line, space separated. If less than 5 numbers hold
# the above mentioned property, print less than 5 numbers. Print “No” if no numbers hold the above property.
# Constraints
# All input numbers are integers in range [-1 000 000 … 1 000 000]. The count of numbers is
# in range [1…10 000].

# SOLUTION
# Read and split the numbers from the list.
# Calculate the average.
# Create a result list.

numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
result = []

# Check if there are less than 5 numbers in the list and print 'No'.

if len(numbers) < 5:
    print("No")

# Loop through the numbers in the list and chek if they are bigger than the average.
# Add them to the result list.

for num in numbers:
    if num > average:
        result.append(num)

# Use the .sort() method to reverse the list.

result.sort(reverse=True)

# Unpack the biggest 5 numbers, separated by a single space.

print(*result[0:5], sep=' ')
