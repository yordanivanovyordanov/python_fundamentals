# CHRISTMAS SPIRIT
# It's time to get in a Christmas mood. You have to decorate the house in time for the big event, but you have
# limited days to do so. You will receive allowed quantity for one type of decoration and days left until
# Christmas day to decorate the house. There are 4 types of decorations and each piece costs a price
# •	Ornament Set – 2$ a piece
# •	Tree Skirt – 5$ a piece
# •	Tree Garlands – 3$ a piece
# •	Tree Lights – 15$ a piece
# Every second day you buy an Ornament Set quantity of times and increase your Christmas spirit by 5.
# Every third day you buy Tree Skirts and Tree Garlands (both quantity of times) and increase your spirit by 13.
# Every fifth day you buy Tree Lights quantity of times and increase your Christmas spirit by 17. If you have
# bought Tree Skirts and Tree Garlands at the same day you additionally increase your spirit by 30.
# Every tenth day you lose 20 spirit, because your cat ruins all tree decorations and you have to rebuild the
# tree and buy one piece of tree skirt, garlands and lights. That is why you are forced to increase the allowed
# quantity with 2 at the beginning of every eleventh day.
# Also if the last day is a tenth day the cat decides to demolish even more and ruins the Christmas turkey
# and you lose additional 30 spirit.
# At the end you must print the total cost and the gained spirit.

# SOLUTION

# The input consist of 2 lines:

quantity = int(input())
days = int(input())

# We will need to create 2 variables one of which will store the total of the "Christmas spirit".
# The second one the total cost of the Christmas decoration.

spirit = 0
total = 0

# These are the prices of the Christmas decoration.

ornament_set_price = 2

# Use a "for" loop from 1 until days + 1, so we can include the last day of the period.
# Within the loop use nested conditionals to check all of the conditions.
# Use Modulo Operator i.e. day % 11 == 0, to check if a certain day meets a certain condition.
