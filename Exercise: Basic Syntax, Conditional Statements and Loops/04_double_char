# DOUBLE CHAR
# Given a string, you have to print a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated.

# SOLUTION
# First we need to read the text from the console by using; "input()".
# Create a new variable with an empty string for the double character text.

text = input()
new_text = ''

# Create a "for" loop and use the build in function "len" to find out how many indices we have in the text.
# Double the indices of the new text.
# Print the result.

for i in range(len(text)):
    new_text += text[i] + text[i]
print(new_text)
