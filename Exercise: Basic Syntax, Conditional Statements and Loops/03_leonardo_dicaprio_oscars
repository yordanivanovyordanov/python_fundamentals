# LEONARDO DICAPRIO OSCARS
# Write a program that receives a single integer number and prints different messages depending on the number:
# -	If Oscar is 88 - "Leo finally won the Oscar! Leo is happy".
# -	If Oscar is 86 - "Not even for Wolf of Wall Street?!"
# -	If Oscar is not 88 nor 86 (and below 88) - "When will you give Leo an Oscar?"
# -	If Oscar is over 88 - "Leo got one already!"

# SOLUTION
# First we need to read the integer number from the console by using; "int(input())".

number = int(input())

# Use a conditional statement to check if the number is "88".
# If it is, print "Leo finally won the Oscar! Leo is happy"
# If not check if the number is "86". If it is, print "Not even for Wolf of Wall Street?!"
# If not check if the number is less than "88". If it is, print "When will you give Leo an Oscar?"
# In all other cases, print "Leo got one already!"

if number == 88:
    print('Leo finally won the Oscar! Leo is happy')
elif number == 86:
    print('Not even for Wolf of Wall Street?!')
elif number < 88:
    print('When will you give Leo an Oscar?')
else:
    print('Leo got one already!')
