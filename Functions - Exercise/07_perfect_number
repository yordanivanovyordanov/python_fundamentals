# PERFECT NUMBER
# Write a function that receives an integer number and returns if this number is perfect or NOT.
# A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
# That is the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum).
# Hint
# Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors
# (including itself) => 6 is a perfect number, because it is the sum of 1 + 2 + 3
# (all of which are divided without residue).

# SOLUTION
num = int(input())


def perfect_number(number):
    positive_divisor = 0

    for i in range(1, number):
        if number % i == 0:
            positive_divisor += i

    if positive_divisor == number:
        return 'We have a perfect number!'
    else:
        return 'It\'s not so perfect.'


result = perfect_number(num)
print(result)
