# LOADING BAY
# You will receive a single integer number between 0 and 100 which is divided with 10 without residue
# (0, 10, 20, 30...).
# Your task is to create a function that visualizes a loading bar depending on that number you
# have received in the input.

# SOLUTION
num = int(input())


def loading_bar(number):
    if number in range(0, 101) and number % 10 == 0:
        if number < 100:
            repetitions = number // 10
            bar = f"{number}% [{'%' * repetitions}{'.' * (10 - repetitions)}]\nStill loading..."
            return bar
        else:
            bar = f"100% Complete!\n[{'%' * 10}]"
            return bar


print(loading_bar(num))
