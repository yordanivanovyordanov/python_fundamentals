# ODD AND EVEN SUM
# You will receive a single number. You have to write a function that returns the sum of all even
# and all odd digits from that number as a single string like in the examples below.

# SOLUTION
number_sequence = int(input())


def odd_and_even_sum(numbers):
    even_sum = 0
    odd_sum = 0

    for num in str(numbers):
        if int(num) % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += int(num)
        else:
            odd_sum += int(num)

    print(f'Odd sum = {odd_sum}, Even sum = {even_sum}')


odd_and_even_sum(number_sequence)
