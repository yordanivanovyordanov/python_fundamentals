# PRIME NUMBER CHECKER
# Write a program to check if a number is prime (only wholly divisible by itself and one).
# The input comes as an integer number.
# The output should be true for prime number and false otherwise.

# SOLUTION
# Use a "While" loop to iterate between 2 and n.
# If n % i == 0, the number is not prime. Print "False".
# Else the number is prime. Print "True".

while True:
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            print('False')
            break
    else:
        print('True')
        break
