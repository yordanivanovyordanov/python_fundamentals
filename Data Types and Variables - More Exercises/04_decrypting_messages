# DECRYPTING MESSAGES
# You will receive a key (integer) and n characters afterward. Add the key to each of the characters
# and append them to a message. At the end print the message, which you decrypted.
# Input
# •	On the first line, you will receive the key
# •	On the second line, you will receive n – the number of lines, which will follow
# •	On the next n lines – you will receive lower and uppercase characters from the Latin alphabet
# Output
# Print the decrypted message.
# Constraints
# •	The key will be in the interval [0…20]
# •	n will be in the interval [1…20]
# •	The characters will always be upper or lower-case letters from the English alphabet
# •	You will receive one letter per line

# SOLUTION
# Read the key from the console.

key = int(input())
letters = int(input())

decrypted = ''

# Use a "for" loop to iterate through all the lines.
# Use the function "ord()" to get the ASCII number of the letter and add the key value.
# Use the "chr()" function to convert the number to a letter.
# Add the letter to the decrypted message and print it out.

for letter in range(letters):
    decrypted += chr(ord(input()) + key)
print(decrypted)
