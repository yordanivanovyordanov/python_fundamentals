# BIGGEST OF THREE NUMBERS
# Write a program that receives three whole numbers and print the biggest one.

# SOLUTION 1
# First we need to read three integer numbers from the console by using; "int(input())".

num_one = int(input())
num_two = int(input())
num_three = int(input())

# To find the biggest number we could use if-else statement:
# Check if num_one is bigger than num_two and num_three and if it is print it out.

if num_one > num_two and num_one > num_three:
    print(num_one)

# Use "elif" and check if num_two is bigger than num_one and num_three and if it is print it out.

elif num_two > num_one and num_two > num_three:
    print(num_two)

# Use "else" to check if the num_three is the biggest, since this is the only option left.

else:
    print(num_three)

# SOLUTION 2
# Alternative and much shorter way to find the biggest number would be to use the build in "max" function
# which returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.

num_one = int(input())
num_two = int(input())
num_three = int(input())

print(max(num_one, num_two, num_three))
