# EXCHANGE INTEGERS
# Read two integer numbers and after that exchange their values by using some programming logic.
# Print the variable values before and after the exchange, as shown below:

# SOLUTION
# Read the two integer numbers from the console.
# Use string interpolation to print out the results.
# Before we use a = a and b = b.
# After we use a = b and b = a.

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

print('Before:')
print(f'a = {a}')
print(f'b = {b}')
print('After:')
print(f'a = {b}')
print(f'b = {a}')
