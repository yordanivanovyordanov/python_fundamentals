# DISNEYLAND JOURNEY
# Create a program that checks if you can save the money for the Disneyland’s journey.
# You have a certain number of months for which you can collect the money.
# At the end of each month, you save 25% of the cost of the journey.
# At the beginning of every odd month (except the first one) you spent 16% of the money collected so far
# for clothes and shoes.
# Every 4th (fourth) month at the beginning of the month your boss gives you а bonus.
# It is 25% of the money collected so far.
# If you save enough money for the journey, calculate how much money will be left for the souvenirs.
# Then print the following:
# "Bravo! You can go to Disneyland and you will have {money}lv. for souvenirs."
# If the saved money is less you should calculate how much money you need more. Then print the following:
# "Sorry. You need {money}lv. more."
# Both numbers should be formatted to the 2nd decimal place.
# Input
# •	On the 1st line you will receive how much the journey will cost – a real number in the range [500.0…10000.0]
# •	On the 2nd line you will receive the number of months for which you have to collect money –
# an integer number in the range [1…12]
# Output
# •	 Print the output in the format described above.

# SOLUTION
money_needed = float(input())
months = int(input())

savings = 0

for month in range(1, months + 1):
    if month > 1 and month % 2 == 1:
        savings -= savings * 0.16

    if month % 4 == 0:
        savings += savings * 0.25

    savings += money_needed * 0.25

if savings >= money_needed:
    print(f"Bravo! You can go to Disneyland and you will have {savings - money_needed:.2f}lv. for souvenirs.")
else:
    print(f"Sorry. You need {money_needed - savings:.2f}lv. more.")
