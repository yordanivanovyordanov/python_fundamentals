# ARCHERY TOURNAMENT
# On the first line you will receive integers separated by "|", representing the targets in the archery field.
# On the next lines until you receive "Game over" command, you will receive commands by the Judge of the
# tournament:
# •	"Shoot Left@{start index}@{length}":
# 	Iskren starts traversing the archery field to the left from {start index} with given {length}.
# 	If he goes out of the field, he will continue from the end of the field.
# •	"Shoot Right@{start index}@{length}":
# 	Iskren starts traversing the archery field to the right from {start index} with given {length}.
# 	If he goes out of the field, he will continue from the start of the field.
# •	"Reverse":
# Reverse the archery field.
# •	"Game Over"
# Print the archery field and collected points.
# When he arrives at the target, he will shoot at it and increase his points by 5 and
# decrease the target by 5 points, if the target points are less than 5, he takes all of them and
# decreases it to 0. If the start index is out of range of the field Iskren will have to ignore the command.
# Input
# •	On the first line, you will receive integers separated by "|" representing the targets in the archery field.
# •	On the next lines, until the "Game over" command you will receive commands in the format described above.
# Output
# •	Print the field in following format: "{target} - {target} - {target} ….. - {target}".
# "Iskren finished the archery tournament with {points}!"
