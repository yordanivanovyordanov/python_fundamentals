# NATIONAL COURT
# Every day thousands of people pass by the reception at "National Court" with various questions
# to ask and the employees have to help everyone by providing correct information and to answer all
# questions.
# There are 3 employees working on the reception all day long. Each of them can handle different
# number of people per hour. Your task is to calculate how much time it will take to answer all the
# questions of a given number of people.
# First you will receive 3 lines with integers, representing the count of people that each of the
# employee can help per hour. On the next line you will receive the total people count as a single integer.
# Every fourth hour all the employees have a one-hour break before they start working again.
# This is the only break they get because they don`t need rest and have no personal life.
# Calculate the time needed to answer all people`s questions and print it in the following format:
# "Time needed: {time}h."
# Input / Constraints
# •	On first three lines -  each employee`s efficiency -  an integer in the range [1 - 100]
# •	On the fourth line - people count – an integer in the range [0 – 10000]
# •	Input will always be valid and in the range specified
# Output
# •	Print a single line: "Time needed: {time}h."
# •	Allowed working time / memory: 100ms / 16MB

# SOLUTION

queries_per_receptionist_1 = int(input())
queries_per_receptionist_2 = int(input())
queries_per_receptionist_3 = int(input())
total_queries = int(input())

hours_needed = 0
queries_per_hour = (queries_per_receptionist_1 + queries_per_receptionist_2 + queries_per_receptionist_3)

while total_queries > 0:
    total_queries -= queries_per_hour
    hours_needed += 1

    if hours_needed % 4 == 0:
        hours_needed += 1

print(f'Time needed: {math.ceil(hours_needed)}h.')
