# SHOPPING LIST
# It’s the end of the week and it is time for you to go shopping, so you need to create a shopping
# list first.
# Input
# You will receive an initial list with groceries separated by "!".
# After that you will be receiving 4 types of commands, until you receive "Go Shopping!"
# •	Urgent {item} - add the item at the start of the list.  If the item already exists, skip this command.
# •	Unnecessary {item} - remove the item with the given name, only if it exists in the list.
# Otherwise skip this command.
# •	Correct {oldItem} {newItem} – if the item with the given old name exists, change its name with the new one.
# If it doesn't exist, skip this command.
# •	Rearrange {item} - if the grocery exists in the list, remove it from its current position and
# add it at the end of the list.
# Constraints
# •	There won`t be any duplicate items in the initial list
# Output
# Print the list with all the groceries, joined by ", ".
# •	"{firstGrocery}, {secondGrocery}, …{nthGrocery}"
