# INVENTORY
# Input / Constraints
# You will receive a journal with some Collecting items, separated with ', ' (comma and space).
# After that, until receiving "Craft!" you will be receiving different commands.
# Commands (split by " - "):
# •	"Collect - {item}" – Receiving this command, you should add the given item in your inventory.
# If the item already exists, you should skip this line.
# •	"Drop - {item}" – You should remove the item from your inventory, if it exists.
# •	"Combine Items - {oldItem}:{newItem}" – You should check if the old item exists,
# if so, add the new item after the old one. Otherwise, ignore the command.
# •	"Renew – {item}" – If the given item exists, you should change its position and put it last in your
# inventory.
# Output
# After receiving "Craft!" print the items in your inventory, separated by ", " (comma and space).
