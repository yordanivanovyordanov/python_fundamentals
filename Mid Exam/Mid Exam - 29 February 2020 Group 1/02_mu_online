# MU ONLINE
# You have initial health 100 and initial bitcoins 0. You will be given a string,
# representing the dungeons rooms. Each room is separated with '|' (vertical bar): "room1|room2|room3…"
# Each room contains a command and a number, separated by space. The command can be:
# •	"potion"
# o	You are healed with the number in the second part. But your health cannot exceed your initial
# health (100).
# o	First print: "You healed for {amount} hp.".
# o	After that, print your current health: "Current health: {health} hp.".
# •	"chest"
# o	You've found some bitcoins, the number in the second part.
# o	Print: "You found {amount} bitcoins."
# •	In any other case you are facing a monster, you are going to fight. The second part of the room,
# contains the attack of the monster. You should remove the monster's attack from your health.
# o	If you are not dead (health <= 0) you've slain the monster, and you should print
# ("You slayed {monster}.")
# o	If you've died, print "You died! Killed by {monster}." and your quest is over.
# Print the best room you`ve manage to reach: "Best room: {room}".
# If you managed to go through all the rooms in the dungeon, print on the next three lines:
# "You've made it!", "Bitcoins: {bitcoins}", "Health: {health}".
# Input / Constraints
# You receive a string, representing the dungeons rooms, separated with '|' (vertical bar):
# "room1|room2|room3…".
# Output
# Print the corresponding messages, described above.
