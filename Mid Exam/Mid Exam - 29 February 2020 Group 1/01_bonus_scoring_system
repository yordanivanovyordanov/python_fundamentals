# BONUS SCORING POINTS
# Create a program that calculates bonus points for each student, for a certain course.
# On the first line, you are going to receive the count of the students for this course.
# On the second line, you will receive the count of the lectures in the course.
# Every course has an additional bonus. You are going to receive it on the third line.
# On the next lines, you will be receiving the count of attendances for each student.
# The bonus is calculated with the following formula:
# {total bonus} = {student attendances} / {course lectures} * (5 + {additional bonus})
# Find the student with the maximum bonus and print him/her, along with his attendances
# in the following format:
# "Max Bonus: {maxBonusPoints}."
# "The student has attended {studentAttendances} lectures."
# Round the bonus points at the end to the nearest bigger number.
# Input / Constrains
# •	On the first line you are going to receive the count of the students –
# an integer number in the range [0…50]
# •	On the second line you are going to receive the count of the lectures –
# an integer number in the range [0...50].
# •	On the third line you are going to receive the initial bonus –
# an integer number in the range [0….100].
# •	On the next lines, you will be receiving the attendances of each student.
# •	There will never be students with equal bonuses.
# Output
# •	Print the maximum bonus points along with the attendances of the given student,
# rounded to the nearest bigger number, scored by a student in this course in the format described above.
