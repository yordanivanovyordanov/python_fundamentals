# BISCUITS FACTORY
# Create a program that calculates how many biscuits your factory can make for a month (30 days)
# and the percentage of production compared to another factory production.
# First, you will receive the biscuits produced per day (per worker). After that,
# you will receive the count of the workers in your factory. Last, you will receive the number of biscuits
# that the competing factory produces for 30 days.
# You need to calculate the production of your factory for 30 days.
# Then you have to calculate how much more or fewer biscuits you produce compared to the other factory
# (in percentage). There will be no case where the factories will produce the same amount of biscuits.
# Every third day the workers produce only 75% of the usual production.
# Keep in mind that there can be only a whole biscuit after making calculations for each day –
# format them to the lower number.
# In the end, print the amount of biscuits produced for 30 days in the following format:
# "You have produced {countBiscuits} biscuits for the past month."
# Then print the percentage of the difference, formatted to the 2nd decimal place, in the following format:
# If your production is bigger than the other factory:
# "You produce {percentage} percent more biscuits."
# If not:
#  "You produce {percentage} percent less biscuits."
# Input
# •	On the first line you will receive the amount of biscuits a worker produce a day –
# an integer number in the range [1…200]
# •	On the second line you will receive the count of the workers in your factory –
# an integer number in the range [1…1000]
# •	On the third line you will receive the amount of biscuits that the competing factory produces for 30 days
# – an integer number in the range[1…2000]
#
# NOTE: The input will always be in the right format.
# Output
# •	In the end print the amount of biscuits produced for 30 days and the percentage of the difference
# formatted to the 2nd decimal place in the format described above.
# Constraints
# •	Percentage can be over 100%.
# •	There will be no case where the factories will produce the same amount of biscuits.
