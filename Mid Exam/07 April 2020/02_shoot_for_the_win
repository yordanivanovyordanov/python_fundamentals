#  SHOOT FOR THE WIN
# Write a program that helps you keep track of your shot targets. You will receive a sequence with integers,
# separated by single space, representing targets and their value. Afterwards, you will be receiving
# indices until the "End" command is given and you need to print the targets and the count of shot targets.
# Every time you receive an index, you need to shoot the target on that index, if it is possiblie.
# Everytime you shoot a target, its value becomes -1 and it is considered shot.
# Along with that you also need to:
# •	Reduce all the other targets, which have greater values than your current target, with its value.
# •	All the targets, which have less than or equal value to the shot target,
# you need to increase with its value.
# Keep in mind that you can't shoot a target, which is already shot. You also can't increase or reduce a
# target, which is considered shot.
# When you receive the "End" command, print the targets in their current state and the count of shot
# targets in the following format:
# "Shot targets: {count} -> {target1} {target2}… {targetn}"
# Input / Constraints
# •	On the first line of input you will receive a sequence of integers, separated by a single space –
# the targets sequence.
# •	On the next lines, until the "End" command you be receiving integers each on a single line –
# the index of the target to be shot.
# Output
# •	The format of the output is described above in the problem description.

# SOLUTION
